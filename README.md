# model-registry-operator

![build checks status](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/model-registry-operator/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

The Model Registry Operator is a controller for deploying [OpenShift AI Model Registry](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/model-registry) in a Kubernetes namespace. 

## Description
The controller reconciles `ModelRegistry` Custom Resources to deploy a Model Registry instance and creates a service for its API. 

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

`ModelRegistry` service needs a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. A sample Postgres configuration for testing (without TLS security) is included 
in [postgres-db.yaml](config/samples/postgres/postgres-db.yaml) and a sample MySQL configuration for testing is included
in [mysql-db.yaml](config/samples/mysql/mysql-db.yaml).
To use another PostgreSQL instance, comment the line that includes the sample DB in [kustomization.yaml](config/samples/postgres/kustomization.yaml) and to use 
your own mysql instance comment the line that includes the sample DB in [kustomization.yaml](config/samples/mysql/kustomization.yaml).

### Secure Model Registry
The operator supports creating secure model registries using [OpenShift OAuth Proxy](#openshift-oauth-proxy-configuration).
OpenShift OAuth Proxy is recommended for its simplicity and ease of use.

## OpenShift OAuth Proxy Configuration
_Skip this section if you are not using OpenShift OAuth._

The operator supports creating secure model registries using [OpenShift OAuth Proxy](https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy).
It leverages [OpenShift Service Certificates](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/security_and_compliance/configuring-certificates#add-service-certificate_service-serving-certificate)
for generating service certificates and
[OpenShift Routes](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/networking/configuring-routes)
for exposing service to external clients outside the OpenShift Cluster.

OpenShift OAuth Proxy samples work best in an OpenShift cluster. It can leverage serving certificates and OpenShift Routes with practically zero extra configuration for security.
For non-OpenShift clusters or for custom service certificates, a secret needs to be created with the name `<registry-name>-oauth-proxy` in the registry namespace. 
This secret can then be configured in the `spec.oauthProxy.tlsCertificateSecret`, and `spec.oauthProxy.tlsKeySecret` properties of the model registry resource. 
To disable external access to the service from outside the cluster, set the property `spec.oauthProxy.serviceRoute` to `disabled`. 
For non-OpenShift clusters, external access has to be manually configured using [Kubernetes Gateway](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/) configuration. 

### Running on the cluster
1. Deploy the controller to the cluster using the `latest` docker image:

```sh
make deploy
```

2. The operator includes multiple samples that use [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to create a sample model registry `modelregistry-sample`.

* [MySQL](config/samples/mysql) plain Kubernetes model registry services with a sample MySQL database
* [MySQL with OAuth Proxy](config/samples/oauth/mysql) MySQL database, and OAuth Proxy secured model registry service
* [Secure MySQL](config/samples/secure-db/mysql) plain Kubernetes model registry services with a sample SSL secured MySQL database
* [Secure MySQL with OAuth Proxy](config/samples/secure-db/mysql-oauth) SSL secured MySQL database, and OAuth Proxy secured model registry service
* [PostgreSQL](config/samples/postgres) plain Kubernetes model registry services with a sample PostgreSQL database
* [PostgreSQL with OAuth Proxy](config/samples/oauth/postgres) PostgreSQL database, and OAuth Proxy secured model registry service

#### Authorization
For all OAuth Proxy samples, a Kubernetes user or serviceaccount authorization token MUST be passed in calls to model registry services using the header:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer sha256~xxx
```

In OpenShift clusters, the user session token can be obtained using the command:

```shell
oc whoami -t
```

To help authorize users and service accounts to access the registry, the model registry operator creates a `Role` named `registry-user-<registry-name>`. 
This role has the required permission to perform a GET on the model registry instance service, e.g. `modelregistry-sample` service. 
In addition, if running in an OpenShift cluster the operator creates an OpenShift user `Group` called `<registry-name>-users`. 
So, for included samples it creates a Role named `registry-user-modelregistry-sample` and a Group named `modelregistry-sample-users`.

A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster administrator can then add users to the `Group`, or create `RoleBinding` for the `Role` to grant permission to specific users and serviceaccounts to access the model registry. 

NOTE: The operator deletes the Group and the Role when the model registry custom resource is deleted. 
If you have created your own RoleBindings to this Role, the operator will not remove them automatically and hence must be removed manually. 

##### TLS Certificates
The project [Makefile](Makefile) includes targets to manage test TLS certificates using a self signed CA certificate. 
To create test certificates in the directory [certs](certs) and Kubernetes secrets in the current namespace, use the command:

```shell
make certificates
```

The test CA certificate is generated in the file [certs/domain.crt](certs/domain.crt) along with certificate for Database service. See [generate_certs.sh](scripts/generate_certs.sh) for details. 

To cleanup the certificates and Kubernetes secrets, use the command:

```shell
make certificates/clean
```

NOTE: The sample database secret `model-registry-db-credential` is created with the CA cert, server key and server cert. However, in production the model registry only needs a secret with the CA cert(s). The production database server will be configured with a secret containing the private key and server cert. 
The sample certificates use a self-signed CA and does not do cert management like cert rotation, etc. Use your own certificate manager, e.g. https://cert-manager.io/ and create generic kubernetes secrets for REST, gRPC and database with the the keys `tls.key`, `tls.crt`, and `ca.crt`. 

Install a model registry instance using **ONE** of the following commands:

NOTE: For Open Data Hub, or OpenShift AI, use the correct registries namespace i.e. `odh-model-registries` or `rhoai-model-registries` respectively.
Which can be provided using either the `-n` option, or setting it as the current namespace first.

```shell
kubectl apply -k config/samples/mysql
kubectl apply -k config/samples/oauth/mysql
kubectl apply -k config/samples/secure-db/mysql
kubectl apply -k config/samples/secure-db/mysql-oauth
kubectl apply -k config/samples/postgres
kubectl apply -k config/samples/oauth/postgres
```

This will create the appropriate database and model registry resources, which will be reconciled in the controller to create a model registry deployment with other Kubernetes, and OpenShift resources as needed.

4. Check that the sample model registry was created using the command:

```shell
kubectl describe mr modelregistry-sample
```

Check the `Status` of the model registry resource for failed Conditions. 

#### Verifying the Model Registry REST Service

##### Verifying OAuth Proxy Sample
For non-OpenShift clusters or when using a custom service certificate, create a TLS secret using the command:

```shell
kubectl create secret tls modelregistry-sample-oauth-proxy --cert=path/to/cert/file --key=path/to/key/file
```

Verify that the Route was created using the command:

```shell
kubectl get routes.route.openshift.io modelregistry-sample-https
```

Use the following command to get the OpenShift Route Host:

```shell
export ROUTE_HOST=`kubectl get routes.route.openshift.io modelregistry-sample-https -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}'`
```

Then verify the REST service using the command:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://$ROUTE_HOST/api/model_registry/v1alpha3/registered_models
```

Where, `$TOKEN` environment variable is set to the client token. If using OpenShift, the token can be set using the command:

```shell
export TOKEN=`oc whoami -t`
```

Note: If the OpenShift cluster uses a non-public CA, it needs be provided using `--cacert` curl option,
or use the `-k` option to skip certificate verification in development and testing environments.

##### Verifying non-Auth Sample
If using a non-Auth sample and using OpenShift, enable the OpenShift Route using the command:

```shell
kubectl patch mr modelregistry-sample --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/rest/serviceRoute", "value": "enabled"}]'
```

Verify that the Route was created using the command:

```shell
kubectl get routes.route.openshift.io modelregistry-sample-http
```

Use the following command to get the OpenShift Route Host:

```shell
export ROUTE_HOST=`kubectl get routes.route.openshift.io modelregistry-sample-http -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}'`
```

Then verify the REST service using the command:

```shell
curl http://$ROUTE_HOST/api/model_registry/v1alpha3/registered_models
```

##### REST Service Output
The output should be a list of all registered models in the registry, e.g. for an empty registry:

```json
{"items":[],"nextPageToken":"","pageSize":0,"size":0}
```

5. To delete the sample model registry, use **ONE** of the following commands based on the sample type deployed earlier:

NOTE: For Open Data Hub, or OpenShift AI, use the correct registries namespace i.e. `odh-model-registries` or `rhoai-model-registries` respectively.
Which can be provided using either the `-n` option, or setting it as the current namespace first.

```shell
kubectl delete -k config/samples/mysql
kubectl delete -k config/samples/oauth/mysql
kubectl delete -k config/samples/secure-db/mysql
kubectl delete -k config/samples/secure-db/mysql-oauth
kubectl delete -k config/samples/postgres
kubectl delete -k config/samples/oauth/postgres
```

### Building local docker image for development
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/model-registry-operator:tag
```

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/model-registry-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
